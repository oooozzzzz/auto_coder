# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Next.js web application that enables users to upload Excel files, create interactive print templates, and generate Word documents with each page corresponding to a row from the Excel data. The application emphasizes long-term template storage and client-side processing for optimal performance and data privacy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload Excel files to the application, so that I can use the data for document generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the file upload interface THEN the system SHALL accept .xlsx and .xls file formats
2. WHEN a user uploads a valid Excel file THEN the system SHALL parse the data and display it in a preview table
3. WHEN a user uploads an invalid file format THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the Excel file contains multiple sheets THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select which sheet to use
5. IF the Excel file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create custom print templates using an interactive canvas, so that I can design how my data will appear in the generated documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the template constructor THEN the system SHALL display predefined paper formats (A4, A5, etc.)
2. WHEN a user selects a paper format THEN the system SHALL display a virtual canvas representing that paper size
3. WHEN Excel data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display all available column names as draggable elements
4. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL provide system fields like {{currentDate}} as draggable elements
5. WHEN a user drags a field onto the canvas THEN the system SHALL place it at the drop location
6. WHEN a user selects a field on the canvas THEN the system SHALL display a properties panel for styling
7. WHEN a user modifies field properties THEN the system SHALL update font size, weight, and alignment in real-time
8. WHEN a user repositions elements on the canvas THEN the system SHALL save the new coordinates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and manage my templates, so that I can reuse them for future document generation tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a template design THEN the system SHALL provide a save option with name input
2. WHEN a user saves a template THEN the system SHALL store it persistently in IndexedDB
3. WHEN a user accesses template management THEN the system SHALL display all previously saved templates
4. WHEN a user selects a saved template THEN the system SHALL load it into the canvas with all styling preserved
5. WHEN a user attempts to save a template with an existing name THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation to overwrite
6. IF IndexedDB is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error and suggest browser compatibility requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate Word documents from my templates and Excel data, so that I can produce formatted documents for each data row.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Generate DOCX" THEN the system SHALL create a Word document with one page per Excel row
2. WHEN generating documents THEN the system SHALL substitute template placeholders with actual data from each row
3. WHEN the document generation is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically download the .docx file
4. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use Web Workers to prevent UI blocking
5. WHEN system fields like {{currentDate}} are used THEN the system SHALL populate them with current values
6. IF template fields don't match Excel columns THEN the system SHALL leave those fields empty or show placeholder text

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file processing error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN IndexedDB operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or clear instructions
3. WHEN document generation fails THEN the system SHALL show the specific error and suggest solutions
4. WHEN the browser doesn't support required features THEN the system SHALL display compatibility warnings
5. WHEN network issues affect the application THEN the system SHALL continue to function offline for core features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application built with modern TypeScript and Next.js practices, so that it's maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the application THEN the system SHALL use Next.js 14 with App Router
2. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for consistent design
3. WHEN handling Excel files THEN the system SHALL use SheetJS (xlsx) library
4. WHEN generating Word documents THEN the system SHALL use the docx library
5. WHEN storing templates THEN the system SHALL use IndexedDB via idb or dexie.js wrapper
6. WHEN processing heavy operations THEN the system SHALL implement Web Workers to maintain UI responsiveness
7. WHEN writing code THEN all components SHALL be functional components with TypeScript typing
8. WHEN implementing features THEN the code SHALL include comprehensive comments, especially for IndexedDB and docx logic
